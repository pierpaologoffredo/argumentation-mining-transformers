    Function to compute accuracy and F1-score, macro and micro averaged, with the

    Parameters
    ==========
    true_labels: List[int|str]
        The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the true labels
        (ground truth).
    pred_labels: List[int|str]
        The list (or can be any ordered iterable as well) of the predicted

    relevant_labels: Optional[List[int|str]]
        If given, it will calculate the F1-score micro and macro averaged only
        over the given labels (relevant ones). Useful for example to remove the
        most common labels from the final metrics.
    prefix: Optional[str]
        If given will prepend `<prefix>_` to the name of the metric. Useful to
        check, for example, what was the split the metric was done in (e.g.
        `eval_accuracy`).

    Returns
    =======
    Dict[str, float]
        A mapping between each of the metrics names (optionally with the
        prepended prefix) and the metric value.

    """
    Computes metrics using `seqeval` as a library. These are metrics useful for
    the case of Sequence Labelling, since they evaluate at a sentence level
    (instead of a token level like classic metrics).

    This function uses the `seqeval` library, for more information check:
    https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval

    Parameters
    ==========
    true_labels: List[List[str]]
        The ground truth labels. The format is IOB, must be strings.
        It is a list of lists where each element is the list of labels of a
        single sentence.
    pred_labels: List[List[str]]
        Analogous to `true_labels`, but with each element being a list of
        predictions.
    labels: List[str]
        The list of unique labels.
    prefix: Optional[str]
        If given will prepend `<prefix>_` to the name of the metric. Useful to
